            <p>Robotic missions to Mars and advances in space tourism dominated the space activities of 2021. But in
                2022, the moon is likely to stand out, as companies and governments launch various moon-bound
                spacecraft.</p>

                    In fulfilling its mission, NASA contributes to America's goals in:
